Name       : Jade Cutter 
Description: Jade Cutter is currently a student at Tacoma Community College, having finished an Associate's of Science in Electrical Engineering. She is spending a summer at Cornell University, assisting the astrophysics department with NANOGrav, a national collaboration to detect gravity waves using the time-of-arrival of pulsar signals. She is transferring to the University of Washington this coming fall and working as an undergraduate researcher at the Nano Optoelectronics Integrated Systems Engineering Laboratory.

				<h2>The campsite rule for humanity</h2>

			<p>Hello! My name is Jade and I am a science fiction writer whose background research got way out of hand.</p>
			<p>My days are spent in class and my evenings are spent at the
				Nano Optoelectronic Integrated Systems Engineering laboratory at UW, designing and implementing nanophotonic
				systems. On the weekends, I write fiction, hike, and take care of two cats and the rescue I am currently fostering at
				any given time for the Pacific Northwest Herpetological Society.</p>
			<p>Before returning to college as an adult, I had examined my local job market and chosen to give up my passion for
				space exploration for a more secure local career in electrical engineering. However, I had no intention of giving up
				for good and sought opportunities to enter the space industry as an electrical engineer. Following my time with NANOGrav
				at Cornell University, in which I was able to meet with several professionals in the public and private industry, 
				I learned that what I want to do the most is mission science. My impossible dream is to be an on-board engineer
				for an off-world mission.</p>
			<p>I am aiming to be an avionics engineer or propulsion engineer in the space industry, with special interest toward electric
				propulsion. I ardently want our species to expand out into the other planets and moons of our Solar System, but I
				know our technology is not there yet. I am dedicating my life to improving that technology.</p>
